Introducing Myself

Hello, my name is Joel Mathew, I am a studying here at New Paltz to get a BS in computer science. I have complete majority of the course here for computer science such as all the three foundation computer science courses, Assembly Language, Object Oriented Programing and Software Engineering. This semester however will be the first time I take more career focused courses such as Cyber Security, OS, and this course, Web Development. I’ve mostly been working in Java but over the summer I was dabbling with HTML, CSS, View, and Java Script, React and C#. 
What I want to gain from this course will be app development skills and coming up with a project. I want to see what web development all is about and see if I want to use it as a future career because as of right now, I honestly don’t know where in the field I want to be in. I do love coding a lot and I may start steering toward game development, but I also want to see what other aspects of the field can offer such as this. From the different code languages, we will be studying things like cloud development. I can’t wait to see how this semester will turn out.
